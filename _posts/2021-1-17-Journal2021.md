This post is a marker to list all the items that I want to achieve in 2021. Come the end of the year I will review this list and score the list. Perhaps I will have to understand that I can not acheive everything anf time is always against me. 

- AWS Cloud Certification
	- Ready to go system in the cloud
- Local system build out
	- this includes fully running 
		- cisco labs, 
		- efs labs, 
		- proxmox
		- containers
